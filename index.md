# DSC 180A – Methodology 4

**Name:** John W. Collins  
**Email:** jcollins@ucsd.edu  

**Section:** [e.g., WIA]  
**Mentor:** [Name]

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic was building agentic AI workflows with LangGraph, where language models reason through structured steps. 
Integrating Neo4j graphs with LLMs showed how AI can query and connect biomedical entities dynamically.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I’d like to develop a memory-augmented biomedical assistant that tracks user sessions and refines answers over time. 
The goal would be to test how conversation history and semantic enrichment improve query accuracy.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would modularize the workflow architecture earlier, separating state logic, workflow control, and database access. 
This would simplify adding features like persistent memory or multi-turn reasoning.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I want to explore graph embeddings and RAG pipelines to combine structured Neo4j data with biomedical text. 
I’m also interested in testing LangGraph parallel branches for comparing reasoning paths.
